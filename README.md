## Professional Statement

I am a highly motivated and passionate individual with over eight years of solid background in systems and network administration, with core strengths in network security, system optimization and python programming. 

As I expand my skill in cybersecurity, I am particularly focused on learning more about advanced threat intelligence and analysis techniques, as well as emerging technologies like cloud security and Internet of Things (IoT) security. I am driven by the constant challenge of staying one step ahead to protect systems and prevent cyber threats.

Cybersecurity excites me because of its critical role in safeguarding organizations and people in an increasingly interconnected world.
