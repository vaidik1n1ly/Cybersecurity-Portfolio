# Scenario

You’re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) threat model framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app and determine whether the app is safe to launch.

Review the following description of why the sneaker company decided to develop this new app:

> **Description**: 
>
> Our application should seamlessly connect sellers and shoppers. It should be easy for users to sign-up, log in, and manage their accounts. Data privacy is a big concern for us. We want users to feel confident that we’re being responsible with their information.
>
> Buyers should be able to directly message sellers with questions. They should also have the ability to rate sellers to encourage good service. Sales should be clear and quick to process. Users should have several payment options for a smooth checkout process. Proper payment handling is really important because we want to avoid legal issues.
