                <li>Why did the incident happen?</li>
                <ul><li>The security incident happened because an organized group of unethical hackers were able to access the health care company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's computers which encrypted critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial as a ransom note was displayed on computers demanding large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.</li></ul>
