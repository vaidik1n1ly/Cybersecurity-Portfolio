# Apply filters to SQL queries

### Project description
My organization is working to make its system more secure. I am responsible for ensuring system security, 
investigating potential security issues, and updating employee computers as needed. 
Below are some examples of how I used SQL queries with filters to perform the security-related tasks:

### Retrieve after hours failed login attempts

There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). 
All after hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred 
after business hours.

The first part of the screenshot is my query which filters all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. 
I started by selecting all data from the log_in_attempts table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with an AND operator 
to filter the results. The first condition is login_time > '18:00', which filters for the login attempts that 
occurred after 18:00. The second condition is success = FALSE, which filters for the failed login attempts. 

### Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, I needed to review all login attempts 
which occurred on this day and the day before.

The following screenshot shows how I wrote a SQL query to filter the login attempts that occurred on specific dates.

This query returns all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. First, I started by selecting 
all data from the log_in_attempts table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with an OR operator to filter my results. 
The first condition is login_date = '2022-05-09', which filters for logins on 2022-05-09. The second condition 
is login_date = '2022-05-08', which filters for logins on 2022-05-08.

### Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico

After investigating the organizationâ€™s data on login attempts, I believe there is an issue with the login attempts 
that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico.

![Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico](img/Screenshot_8-12-2024_13955.jpeg)

This query returns all login attempts that occurred in countries other than Mexico. First, I started by selecting 
all data from the log_in_attempts table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with NOT filter. I used LIKE with MEX% as the 
pattern to match because the dataset represents Mexico as MEX and MEXICO. The percentage sign (%) is wildcard that 
represents any number of unspecified characters when used with LIKE. 

### Retrieve employees in Marketing

My team wants to update the computers for certain employees in the Marketing department. To do this, I have to get 
information on which employee machines to update.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the 
Marketing department in the East building.

![Retrieve employees in Marketing](img/Screenshot_8-12-2024_131228.jpeg)

This query returns all employees in the Marketing department in the East building. First, I started by selecting 
all data from the employees table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with AND filter. I used LIKE with East% as the pattern 
to match because the data in the office column represents the East building with the specific office number. The 
first condition is the department = 'Marketing' portion, which filters for employees in the Marketing department. 
The second condition is the office LIKE 'East%' portion, which filters for employees in the East building.

### Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales

The machines for employees in the Finance and Sales departments also need to be updated. Since a different security 
update is needed, I have to get information on employees only from these two departments.

The following screenshot shows how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the 
Finance or Sales departments.

![Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales](img/Screenshot_8-12-2024_13153.jpeg)

This query returns all employees in the Finance and Sales departments. First, I started by selecting all data 
from the employees table. 
Then, I used a WHERE clause with OR to filter for employees who are in the Finance and Sales departments. I used the 
OR operator instead of AND because I want all employees who are in either department. The first condition is 
department = 'Finance', which filters for employees from the Finance department. The second condition is 
department = 'Sales', which filters for employees from the Sales department.

### Retrieve all employees not in IT

My team needs to make one more security update on employees who are not in the Information Technology department. 
To make the update, I first have to get information on these employees.

The following screenshot shows how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees not in the  
Information Technology department.

![Retrieve all employees not in IT](img/Screenshot_8-12-2024_131834.jpeg)

The query returns all employees not in the Information Technology department. First, I started by selecting 
all data from the employees table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with NOT to filter for employees not in this 
department.


### Summary

I used SQL queries with filters to obtain specific information on login attempts and employee computers. 
I accessed two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter 
for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to 
filter for patterns.
