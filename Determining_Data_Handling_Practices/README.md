# Overview
You will review the results of a data risk assessment. 
You will determine whether effective data handling processes are being implemented to protect **information privacy**.

Data is among the most valuable assets in the world today. 
Everything from intellectual property to guest WiFi networks should be protected with a combination of technical, operational, and managerial controls. 
Implementing the **principle of least privilege** is essential to protect information privacy.

The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security control that helps maintain information privacy. 
However, least privilege starts to lose its effectiveness when too many users are given access to information. 
Data leaks commonly happen as information gets passed between people without oversight.

# Scenario

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. 
The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. 
An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. 
You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. 
Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

To start your analysis, review the following incident summary provided by your supervisor:

> *A customer success representative received access to a folder of internal documents from a manager. It contained files associated with a new product offering, including customer analytics and marketing materials. The manager forgot to unshare the folder. Later, the representative copied a link to the marketing materials to share with a business partner during a sales call. Instead, the representative shared a link to the entire folder. During the sales call, the business partner received the link to internal documents and posted it to their social media page.*
